Ultimately, both Schumachers were giants and Verstappen is very similar to them, especially Schumacher. Whether he could really beat them - it's impossible to say. They are completely different eras with different cars. In Schumacher's time, it was all about absolute speed. You always had to drive at the absolute limit. Today it's completely different. You actually have to drive as slowly as possible. Both require completely different things. That's why it's difficult to make such judgments. All you can say is that Schumacher, Senna and Verstappen or even Jim Clark were the best drivers of their time. They all drove or drive at such a level that is unique and makes them one of the four greats. And it's impossible to say who was better or who would beat who.",
